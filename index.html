									<h2>WHAT IS <br />
									REDBULL F1</h2>
									<p> <b>Red Bull Racing entered Formula 1 in 2005 after acquiring Jaguar Racing, with its headquarters in Milton Keynes, UK. 
									Initially dismissed as a flashy marketing move by an energy drink brand, Red Bull quickly proved its seriousness by hiring top engineering talent like Adrian Newey, one of the greatest car designers in F1 history. 
									After some building years with moderate success, the team's true breakthrough came in 2010 when young German driver Sebastian Vettel won his first World Drivers’ Championship and led Red Bull to its first Constructors’ Championship. 
									This sparked a golden era from 2010 to 2013 where Red Bull dominated F1, winning four consecutive double titles (Drivers’ and Constructors’) with Vettel. However, with the start of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014, Red Bull struggled to keep up with Mercedes due to underperforming Renault engines. 
									Despite this, they remained competitive with several podiums and wins. In 2016, Red Bull took a bold step by promoting teenager Max Verstappen, who won his debut race with the team and became the youngest F1 winner ever. 
									Over the next few years, the team built itself around Verstappen, and by 2021, they had fully returned to championship contention, winning a dramatic and controversial title in Abu Dhabi. 
									With the help of Honda engines and exceptional car development, Red Bull dominated the 2022 and 2023 seasons, with Verstappen breaking several records. 
									By 2024, Red Bull had cemented itself not just as a challenger but as a modern dynasty in F1, balancing cutting-edge technology, bold race strategies, and a strong brand identity. 
									Even after leadership changes in 2025, including Christian Horner’s exit, the team aims to stay on top with upcoming partnerships like Red Bull-Ford from 2026, showing their long-term commitment to excellence and innovation in Formula 1.</b></p>
